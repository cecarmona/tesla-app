# Tesla App created with React Native

This is a clone for Tesla website that I created using React Native with Expo Cli,
you can use this app on IOS or Android Devices!

## EXPO CLI - Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `expo start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
When you run expo start (or npm start), Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Using Emulator`

You could use IOS Emulator from XCode, if you're using Mac.\
Or Android Studio if you're using windows!

### `Check Expo Documentation if you need to know anything else about it!`

See the section about [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.io/) for more information.
